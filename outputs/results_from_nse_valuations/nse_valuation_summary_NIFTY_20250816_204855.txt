================================================================================

VALUATION METHODOLOGY:

1. THEORETICAL PRICING (Black-Scholes Model):
   - Calculates fair value using Black-Scholes formula for European options
   - Inputs: Spot price, Strike price, Time to expiry, Risk-free rate (6%), Implied volatility
   - Handles both calls and puts with proper mathematical implementation

2. ENHANCED VALUATION MODEL (Advanced):
   - Multi-factor scoring system beyond simple percentage difference
   - Moneyness Factor: Higher tolerance for OTM options (more uncertainty)
   - Time Decay Factor: Higher tolerance for near-expiry options
   - Volatility Factor: Higher tolerance in high-volatility environments
   - Liquidity Factor: Higher tolerance for wide bid-ask spreads
   - Confidence Score: Indicates reliability based on data quality factors
   - Rating Categories: strongly undervalued → strongly overvalued

3. SIMPLE VALUATION MODEL (Basic):
   - Traditional percentage-based approach
   - Compares theoretical vs. market price directly
   - Uses 5% tolerance threshold for over/under valuation
   - Rating Categories: undervalued, fairly priced, overvalued

4. CONFIDENCE SCORING (Enhanced Model Only):
   - Base confidence from sigmoid function around tolerance levels
   - Data quality boost for tight bid-ask spreads (< 5% = +15%, < 10% = +10%)
   - Volume boost for actively traded options (> 100 contracts = +10%)
   - Moneyness boost for ATM options (closer to spot = higher confidence)
   - Time boost for longer-dated options (less time decay noise)

5. DATA QUALITY FILTERS:
   - Focuses on liquid options with open interest and trading volume
   - Filters out extreme mispricing (>500%) likely due to data errors
   - Uses bid-ask mid-price when last price is unavailable
   - Applies reasonable default volatility when implied vol is missing

The enhanced model provides more nuanced analysis but requires quality market data.
