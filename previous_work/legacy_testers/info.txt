   deprecated functions, or may not work with the current version of the 
   NSE scraper and related modules.

2. **PROPER LOCATION**: If you need to use any of these test files, 
   they should be moved to the main `testers/` folder before running.

5. **RECOMMENDED APPROACH**:
   - Use the current testers in the main `testers/` folder instead
