Financial Utilities Module - Core Options Analysis Engine
======================================================

This module contains the core financial calculation engine for options analysis, providing
professional-grade implementations of Black-Scholes pricing, Greeks calculation, and advanced
valuation algorithms.

Core Functions:
1. black_scholes_price(S, K, T, r, sigma, option_type)
   - Calculates theoretical price for European options using Black-Scholes model
   - Handles both calls and puts with proper mathematical implementation
   - Inputs: Spot price, Strike, Time to expiry, Risk-free rate, Volatility, Option type

2. black_scholes_greeks(S, K, T, r, sigma, option_type)
   - Calculates all major Greeks: Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho
   - Returns normalized values (Vega per 1% vol change, Rho per 1% rate change)
   - Essential for risk management and portfolio analysis

3. option_valuation(theoretical_price, market_price, ...)
   - Advanced valuation system considering multiple real-world factors:
     * Moneyness factor (distance from ATM)
     * Time decay effects
     * Volatility environment
     * Bid-ask spread liquidity
     * Market confidence factors
   - Returns: (rating, percentage_difference, confidence_level)
   - Ratings: strongly undervalued â†’ strongly overvalued

4. simple_option_valuation(theoretical_price, market_price, tolerance)
   - Legacy simple valuation based on percentage difference
   - Useful for basic analysis or when detailed factors unavailable

Mathematical Foundation:
- Implements standard Black-Scholes formulas for European options
- Uses scipy.stats.norm for cumulative normal distribution
- Proper handling of edge cases and mathematical constraints
- Professional-grade precision and error handling

Usage:
    from utils import black_scholes_price, black_scholes_greeks, option_valuation
    
    # Calculate option price
    price = black_scholes_price(100, 100, 0.25, 0.05, 0.2, 'call')
    
    # Calculate Greeks
    greeks = black_scholes_greeks(100, 100, 0.25, 0.05, 0.2, 'call')
    
    # Advanced valuation
    rating, pct_diff, confidence = option_valuation(theo_price, market_price, ...)

Dependencies:
- math: For mathematical operations (log, sqrt, exp)
- scipy.stats.norm: For cumulative normal distribution calculations

This module serves as the foundation for all options analysis in the project,
providing reliable, tested financial calculations used by all other scripts.

    Enhanced option valuation considering multiple real-world factors beyond simple percentage difference.
    
    This function implements a sophisticated scoring system that accounts for:
    1. MONEYNESS FACTOR: How far in/out of the money the option is
       - Uses exponential decay: further from ATM = higher tolerance for mispricing
       - OTM options have more uncertainty in pricing due to lower probability of exercise
    
    2. TIME DECAY FACTOR: Time value considerations
       - Shorter time to expiry = higher tolerance (more uncertainty about final outcome)
       - Uses exponential decay with time: exp(-T * 2)
       - Accounts for accelerated time decay near expiration
    
    3. VOLATILITY FACTOR: Uncertainty in underlying asset movement
       - Higher volatility = higher tolerance (more uncertainty about future price movements)
       - Capped at 20% to prevent excessive tolerance
       - Reflects that high vol environments have more pricing noise
    
    4. LIQUIDITY FACTOR: Bid-ask spread considerations
       - Wider spreads indicate lower liquidity and higher transaction costs
       - Higher spread = higher tolerance for mispricing
       - Accounts for market maker risk and transaction friction
    
    5. NON-LINEAR SCORING: Sigmoid function for smooth transitions
       - Provides gradual transitions between valuation categories
       - Avoids sharp cutoffs that don't reflect real market conditions
       - Confidence score indicates reliability of the valuation
